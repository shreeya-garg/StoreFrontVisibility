        <p>Store visibility is an important consideration in retail location decisions because it directly impacts customer traffic and, consequently, revenue. A location with high visibility, such as a corner spot or a storefront facing a busy street, ensures that potential customers can easily see and access the business. Conversely, a hidden or obscured location can drastically limit foot traffic, even if the surrounding area has high population density. Effective visibility translates to increased brand awareness, spontaneous purchases, and ultimately, a greater chance of business success. However, accurately quantifying a location's visibility is a complex task, as it involves factors beyond simple street frontage, such as pedestrian flow patterns, competing signage, and the presence of visual obstructions, making it difficult to obtain reliable data and make informed decisions. </p>
